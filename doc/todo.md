# Bevel Todos

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things to complete with Bevel before the 0.1 release:

* [ ] Add runtime relation existence errors (Relation not found crashing)
* [ ] Add compile time relation existence errors
* [ ] Add singular variable warnings
* [ ] Make undefined variable errors non-panics
* [ ] Create test cases to make sure `10 ~ x + 5`-like cases are useful
* [ ] Document lists.bv example, and make sure to flesh out documentation overall
